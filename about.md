My name is Vasilis Soumakis and I am a senior software engineer from Athens, Greece. I have worked extensively with the
JVM ecosystem utilizing Java, Scala, Kotlin and Groovy. What drives me forward is functional programming, software
architecture and
well crafted code.

As a hobby, I am enjoying writing technical articles and tutorials sharing my knowledge, listening to podcasts,
travelling and working out.
